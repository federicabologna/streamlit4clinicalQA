{"question_id": "question_48", "question": "Does hydroxyzine have any affect on metabolism or weight gain?", "answer_id": "llama_45", "answer": "Hydroxyzine, an antihistamine medication, is primarily used to treat anxiety, itching, and hives. While hydroxyzine is not directly known to significantly affect metabolism, it can lead to increased appetite and subsequent weight gain due to its sedative properties and potential to increase cravings for unhealthy snacks. However, the impact of hydroxyzine on weight is generally considered minimal and short-term. Long-term use of antihistamines, including hydroxyzine, may contribute to weight gain in some individuals, but this effect is typically modest and may vary depending on individual factors, such as overall diet and activity level.", "answer_type": "llama", "annotation_type": "coarse", "rated": "No", "batch_id": "batch_4"}
