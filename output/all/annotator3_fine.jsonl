Most people with HPV are unaware they have the infection as they never develop symptoms and the body's immune system is able to clear the virus.\n\n :orange[There is no vaccine for herpes yet, but a HPV vaccine is available.]", "answer_type": "physician", "annotation_type": "fine", "rated": "No", "batch_id": "batch_12", "sentence_id": "physician_14_14"}
