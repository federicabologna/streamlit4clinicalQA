These include: \n\n 1.  **Methotrexate:** This medication is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy as it can lead to fetal defects and miscarriage. \n\n 2.  **Thalidomide:** Also highly teratogenic, meaning it can cause severe birth defects. \n\n 3.  **Certain corticosteroids:** Prolonged or high-dose systemic corticosteroids should be used cautiously, as they can have adverse effects, although they may be necessary in severe cases. \n\n 4.  **Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs):** These are generally avoided especially in the third trimester due to their association with fetal renal issues and risk of heart defects. \n\n Maintaining disease control with safe medications like sulfasalazine, mesalamine, or certain biologics which have a safer profile during pregnancy is crucial.  It\u2019s imperative to discuss and manage medication use with a healthcare provider specializing in gastroenterology and obstetrics to ensure both maternal and fetal health.  :orange[Always consult with a healthcare provider before making any changes to medication regimens during pregnancy.]", "answer_type": "gpt4", "annotation_type": "fine", "rated": "No", "batch_id": "batch_1", "sentence_id": "gpt4_68_8"}
