{"question_id": "question_181", "question": "Whats a cluster headache?", "answer_id": "llama_63", "answer": "Cluster headaches are a type of headache disorder that is characterized by extremely painful and recurring headaches that occur in clusters or cycles.  These headaches are typically one-sided, centered around the eye, and can last anywhere from 15 minutes to 3 hours.  They are often accompanied by other symptoms such as tearing, redness, and swelling of the affected eye, as well as nasal congestion or runny nose. \n\n Cluster headaches are relatively rare, affecting about 1 in 1,000 people, and are more common in men than women.  <mark>The exact cause of cluster headaches is not known, but they are thought to be related to abnormalities in the brain's blood vessels and nerves.</mark> \n\n Cluster headaches can be divided into two main types: episodic and chronic.  Episodic cluster headaches occur in clusters that can last from several weeks to several months, followed by periods of remission.  Chronic cluster headaches occur continuously without periods of remission. \n\n Treatment for cluster headaches usually involves a combination of medications, including triptans, ergotamines, and corticosteroids, as well as oxygen therapy and lifestyle changes.
