They are typically small, shallow, round or oval ulcers that are white or yellow in color with a red border and cause pain, especially when eating or drinking.  Canker sores are not contagious. \n\n Oral herpes, caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), typically presents as clusters of blisters that appear on or around the lips and occasionally on the nose, cheeks, or inside the mouth.  These blisters are often preceded by a tingling or burning sensation before they appear.  Herpes blisters may break open, ooze, and form a crust, and are usually painful.  Oral herpes is contagious, especially when the blisters are visible. \n\n <mark>The location and presentation of the sore, the presence of systemic symptoms (like fever), past frequency and location of sores, as well as response to previous treatments can help distinguish between canker sores and oral herpes. </mark> A healthcare provider can typically diagnose the type of sore based on its appearance and location.

The cuff should be snug but not too tight.\n4.  **Take the measurement**: If using a manual monitor, inflate the cuff by pumping the bulb until the pressure gauge reaches 180-200 mmHg.  Slowly release the air while listening with a stethoscope for the first sound of blood flow (systolic pressure).  Continue releasing air until the sound disappears (diastolic pressure).  If using a digital monitor, follow the manufacturer's instructions.\n5.  <mark>**Record the measurement**: Write down the systolic and diastolic pressures (e.g., 120/80 mmHg).</mark>\n6.  **Repeat the measurement**: Take at least two readings, 1-2 minutes apart, to ensure accuracy. \n\n Remember to follow the American Heart Association's guidelines for blood pressure measurement to ensure accurate results.", "answer_type": "llama", "annotation_type": "fine", "rated": "No", "batch_id": "batch_17", "sentence_id": "llama_15_11"}
