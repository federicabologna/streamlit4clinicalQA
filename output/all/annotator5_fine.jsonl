The lower edge of the cuff should be about an inch above the bend of the elbow.\n\n 4. **Position the Stethoscope**: Place the stethoscope\u2019s earpieces in your ears and the diaphragm on the inside of the elbow crease directly over the brachial artery.\n\n 5. **Inflate the Cuff**: Inflate the cuff by pumping the bulb until the gauge reads about 20-30 mmHg above usual systolic pressure (if unknown, inflate to 180 mmHg). The cuff should compress the arm enough so no pulse is felt at the wrist.\n\n :orange[6. **Measure the Pressure**: Slowly deflate the cuff by opening the valve and listen through the stethoscope.] The first knocking sound (systolic pressure) is noted.

They are typically small, shallow, round or oval ulcers that are white or yellow in color with a red border and cause pain, especially when eating or drinking. Canker sores are not contagious.\n\n Oral herpes, caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), typically presents as clusters of blisters that appear on or around the lips and occasionally on the nose, cheeks, or inside the mouth. These blisters are often preceded by a tingling or burning sensation before they appear. Herpes blisters may break open, ooze, and form a crust, and are usually painful. Oral herpes is contagious, especially when the blisters are visible.\n\n The location and presentation of the sore, the presence of systemic symptoms (like fever), past frequency and location of sores, as well as response to previous treatments can help distinguish between canker sores and oral herpes. A healthcare provider can typically diagnose the type of sore based on its appearance and location.
