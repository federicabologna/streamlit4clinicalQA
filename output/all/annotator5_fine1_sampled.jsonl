Type 1 diabetes, for example, is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, and it can develop rapidly, often over a few weeks.  The symptoms can be severe and include increased thirst and urination, weight loss, blurred vision, and fatigue. \n\n In contrast, Type 2 diabetes tends to develop more gradually and is often associated with insulin resistance.  However, some people with Type 2 diabetes may not exhibit noticeable symptoms in the early stages, and the condition may only be detected through routine blood tests. \n\n Another form of diabetes, known as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), also known as Type 1.5 diabetes, shares characteristics of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.  <mark>Its onset can be gradual or, in some cases, more rapid.</mark> \n\n Lastly, certain medications, pancreatic damage, or other medical conditions can lead to secondary diabetes, which can also have a rapid onset. \n\n It's essential to seek immediate medical attention if you're experiencing symptoms of diabetes, as early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent long-term complications.", "answer_type": "llama", "annotation_type": "fine", "rated": "No", "batch_id": "batch_15", "sentence_id": "llama_79_6"}

Diagnostic imaging studies may be recommended if symptoms persist for >6 weeks or weakness or numbness is experienced. The risk of developing sciatica can be reduced by maintaining good posture and healthy weight, regular exercise, muscle strengthening exercises, and proper lifting techniques. Mild sciatica usually resolves in a few weeks. The following conservative approaches may help relieve pain and speed up recovery: cold or heat packs, over-the-counter analgesics, physiotherapy, and starting gentle exercise as soon as tolerated.
