Different antibiotics are effective against different types of bacteria.  Some antibiotics are broad-spectrum, meaning they can target a wide range of bacteria, while others are narrow-spectrum, targeting only specific types of bacteria. \n\n For example, antibiotics such as penicillin and amoxicillin are effective against streptococcal and staphylococcal infections, while antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are effective against gram-negative bacteria like E.  coli and Pseudomonas. \n\n To determine the most effective antibiotic, a healthcare provider may perform tests such as a culture and sensitivity test, which identifies the type of bacteria and its susceptibility to different antibiotics.  :orange[This ensures that the chosen antibiotic is effective against the specific bacteria causing the infection, reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance and improving treatment outcomes.]", "answer_type": "llama", "annotation_type": "fine", "rated": "No", "batch_id": "batch_1", "sentence_id": "llama_11_6"}
