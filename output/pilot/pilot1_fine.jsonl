It often occurs when water remains in the ear after swimming, creating a moist environment that helps bacterial growth. Other causes include aggressive cleaning of the ear canal which can cause scratches or abrasions, leading to infection. It can also be caused by skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis, which affect the skin of the ear canal. :orange[Inserting devices such as earphones or hearing aids, as well as foreign objects, can also predispose to otitis externa by damaging the delicate skin inside the ear or introducing bacteria.]"}

The most common way to get otitis externa is by exposure to contaminated water while swimming, bathing, or showering, which introduces bacteria into the ear canal. Other risk factors include using earplugs, earbuds, or headphones that can push earwax deeper into the ear canal, creating a moist environment for bacteria to grow. Additionally, using harsh soap, shampoo, or hair spray can also increase the risk of developing otitis externa. Symptoms include ear pain, itching, redness, swelling, and discharge. Treatment usually involves ear drops that contain antibiotics and/or steroids to reduce inflammation."}
