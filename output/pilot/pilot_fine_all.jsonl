Some are available over-the-counter and they are recommended for the treatment of persistent nasal allergy symptoms.\n Nasal antihistamine sprays may also help relieve congestion. \n\n Nasal decongestant sprays can be beneficial for reducing the swelling of the blood vessels and tissues within the nasal passages. However, they should not be used for more than 2-3 days at a time. Frequent or prolonged use can cause \"rebound congestion\" when the decongestant is stopped, which can lead to a cycle of dependency on decongestant sprays. Their short-term use means they are better for treating nasal congestion caused by a cold rather than allergies.\n\n Nasal irrigation or saline sprays can rinse out mucus and allergens from the nasal passages.
