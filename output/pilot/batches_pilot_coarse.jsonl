The kidneys filter creatinine out of the blood and eliminate it through urine. Creatinine levels that are high in the blood and low in urine may indicate kidney problems. Doctors can use creatinine levels, along with patient age, gender, and race, to calculate eGFR, which helps assess kidney function. Healthcare providers may request creatinine testing as part of a regular check-up or if kidney disease is suspected. It's worth noting that intense exercise and some medications can lead to temporarily elevated serum creatinine levels.\n\n", "batch_id": "batch_0"}
{"question_id": "question_89", "question": "Im confused what creatinine?", "answer_id": "gpt4_0", "answer_type": "gpt4", "annotation_type": "coarse", "rated": "No", "answer": "Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscles from the breakdown of a compound called creatine. Creatine is used by muscles for energy. The kidneys filter creatinine from the blood and excrete it in urine. The level of creatinine in your blood and its clearance rate in urine are important indicators of kidney function. High blood levels of creatinine can be a sign of kidney damage or impaired kidney function.", "batch_id": "batch_0"}
{"question_id": "question_89", "question": "Im confused what creatinine?", "answer_id": "llama_0", "answer_type": "llama", "annotation_type": "coarse", "rated": "No", "answer": "Creatinine is a waste product that comes from the normal wear and tear on muscles of the body, and the level of creatinine in your blood is an indicator of kidney function. When your kidneys are working properly, they filter out creatinine from your blood, and it is excreted in your urine. However, if your kidneys are not functioning correctly, the level of creatinine in your blood can increase.\n\nThe serum creatinine test is a common blood test used to evaluate kidney function. It measures the level of creatinine in your blood. A high creatinine level may indicate that your kidneys are not working as well as they should be, which can be a sign of kidney disease or damage.\n\nIn general, a normal creatinine level ranges from 0.6 to 1.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) for adult males and 0.5 to 1.1 mg/dL for adult females, but these values can vary slightly depending on the laboratory and the individual's muscle mass.", "batch_id": "batch_0"}

The main symptoms of esophagitis include difficulty swallowing, pain during swallowing, and a feeling of food being stuck in the throat. However, muscle stiffness in the neck when swallowing is likely related to other causes such as muscular strain, cervical spine disorders, or other conditions affecting the muscles and nerves of the neck. If you are experiencing this symptom, it is important to consult a healthcare provider to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment.", "batch_id": "batch_0"}

While it primarily affects the esophagus, the pain and discomfort can sometimes radiate to nearby areas, including the neck. Muscle stiffness in the neck when swallowing is not a typical symptom of esophagitis, but it is possible for people with esophagitis to experience referred pain or discomfort in the neck area due to the shared nerve pathways between the esophagus and the neck. However, this symptom is more commonly associated with other conditions such as cervical spine disorders, muscle strain, or even conditions like Eagle syndrome, which involves the stylohyoid ligament. If you are experiencing persistent or severe neck stiffness when swallowing, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.", "batch_id": "batch_0"}
