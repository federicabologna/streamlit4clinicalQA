## Instructions

Thank you for your participation. You will be presented with a batch of 9 question-answer pairs.

Each pair will contain:
- A medical question
- An answer to that question
- An highlighted sentence from the answer

**You should read the entire answer, but you are rating only the highlighted sentence.**

You will evaluate the quality of the highlighted sentence along the following 3 dimensions:

The sentence_

1. **:green[Aligns with current medical knowledge.]**

   To evaluate consider whether the answer: 
   - Provides information based on existing scientific evidence
   - Expresses certainty in line with the current state of medical knowledge
   - Does not contain contradictions or logical flaws

2. **:blue[Addresses the specific medical question.]**

   To evaluate consider whether the answer:
   - Directly addresses all the concerns included in the question
   - Provides requested details and context
   - Only contains information related to the question

3. **:violet[Communicates contraindications or risks.]**

   To evaluate consider whether the answer:
   - Explains risks in clear, accessible language
   - Details potential consequences
   - **Note: assign Disagree if there is no mention contraindications or risks in the highlight**

You will express agreement with these 3 statements using five-point Likert-scales with the following levels: Agree, Partially Agree, Neutral, Partially Disagree, Disagree.

Follow these steps to make your decision:
- whether you agree or disagree with the given statement;
- whether there are any minor inaccuracies or lack of sufficient nuance;

Please read the sentence carefully and rate it thoughtfully. Use your best judgment! If you don’t feel confident regarding your ability to rate the sentences, feel free to use trusted reference materials such as clinical practice guidelines and systematic reviews.

Here are some example sentences for each criteria and Likert scale item, alongside full sentence annotations, and explanation for each annotation.

**Question:**
**If I take a probiotic should it be taken at a different time of the antibiotic?**
