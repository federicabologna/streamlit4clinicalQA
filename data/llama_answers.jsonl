However, factors that can increase the risk of developing BV include having multiple sex partners, a new sex partner, or having a female sex partner with BV. Additionally, practices such as douching, not using condoms, and having an intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception may also contribute to the development of BV.\n\nBV can cause symptoms such as thin, white, or gray vaginal discharge with a strong, fishy odor, especially after sexual intercourse, as well as itching or burning sensations in the vagina. Some women with BV may not exhibit any symptoms at all. Treatment for BV typically involves antibiotics, and it's essential for women with symptoms to seek medical evaluation to rule out other potential causes of their symptoms and to receive appropriate treatment.", "answer_type": "llama"}
